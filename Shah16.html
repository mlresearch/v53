	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) currently diagnoses millions of cases of infectious diseases annually, generating population disease distributions that, while accurate, are far too delayed for real-time monitoring. The ability to instantly compile and monitor such distributions is critical in identifying outbreaks and facilitating real-time communication between health authorities and health-care providers. This task, however, is made challenging due to the lack of instantly available public health information, creating a need for the analysis of disease spread on frequently updated social media websites. We introduce a novel pipeline based model to generate a real-time, accurate depiction of infectious disease propagation using Twitter data. Our approach, an amalgam of natural language processing and supervised machine learning, is invariant to mass media hype and significantly reduces the noise introduced by the use of tweets. The correlation coefficient between the Twitter disease distribution obtained via our approach and CDC data from mid-2013 to mid-2014 was 0.983, improving upon the best model published for the 2012-13 flu season. Our model further correlates well with theoretical models of infection spread across airport networks, verifying its robustness and applicability in the public sphere.
