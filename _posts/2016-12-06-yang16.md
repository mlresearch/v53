title: Large Scale CVR Prediction through Dynamic Transfer Learning of Global and
  Local Features
abstract: 'This paper presents a combination of strategies for conversion rate (CVR)
  prediction de- ployed at the Yahoo! demand side platform (DSP) Brightroll, targeting
  at modeling  extremely high dimensional, sparse data with limited human intervention.
  We propose a novel probabilistic generative model by tightly integrating components
  of natural language processing, dynamic transfer learning and scalable prediction,
  named Dynamic Transfer Learning with Reinforced Word Modeling (a.k.a. Trans-RWM
  ) to predict user  conversion rates. Our model is based on assumptions that: on
  a higher level, information can be transferable between related campaigns; on a
  lower level, users who searched similar contents or browsed similar pages would
  have a higher probability of sharing similar latent purchase interests. Novelties
  of this framework include (i) A novel natural language modeling specifically tailored
  for semantic inputs of CVR prediction; (ii) A Bayesian transfer learning model to
  dynamically transfer the knowledge from source to the future target; (iii) An automatic
  new updating rule with adaptive regularization using Stochastic  Gradient Monte
  Carlo to support the efficient updating of Trans-RWM in high-dimensional and sparse
  data. We demonstrate that on Brightroll our framework can effectively discriminate
  extremely rare events in terms of their conversion propensity.'
