title: Contextual Embedding for Distributed Representations of Entities in a Text
  Corpus
abstract: Distributed representations of textual elements in low dimensional vector
  space to  capture context has gained great attention recently. Current state-of-the-art
  word embedding techniques compute distributed representations using co-occurrences
  of words within a  contextual window discounting the flexibility to incorporate
  other contextual phenomena like temporal, geographical, and topical contexts. In
  this paper, we present a flexible framework that has the ability to leverage temporal,
  geographical, and topical information of documents  along with the textual content
  to produce more effective vector representations of entities or words within a document
  collection. The framework first captures contextual  relationships between entities
  collected from different relevant documents and then leverages these relationships
  to produce inputs of a graph, or to train a neural network to produce vectors for
  the entities. Through a set of rigorous experiments we test the performance of our
  approach and results show that our proposed solution can produce more meaningful
  vectors than the state-of-the-art methods.
