abstract: Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our ability to collect
  data from various sensors, devices, in different formats, from independent or connected
  applications The aim of this workshop is to bring together people from both academia
  and industry to present their most recent work related to big-data issues, and exchange
  ideas and thoughts in order to advance this big-data challenge,  which has been
  considered as one of the most exciting opportunities in the past 10 years. Big data
  flood has outpaced our capability to process, analyze, store and understand these
  datasets. Consider the Internet data. The web pages indexed by Google were around
  one million in 1998, but quickly reached 1 billion in 2000 and have already exceeded
  1 trillion in 2008. This rapid expansion is accelerated by the dramatic increase
  in acceptance of social networking applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo,
  etc., that allow users to create contents freely and amplify the already huge Web  volume.
  Furthermore, with mobile phones becoming the sensory gateway to get real-time data
  on people from different aspects, the vast amount of data that mobile carrier can
  potentially process to improve our daily life has  significantly outpaced our past
  CDR (call data record)-based processing for billing purposes only. It can be foreseen  that
  Internet of things (IoT) applications will raise the scale of data to an unprecedented
  level. People and devices  (from home coffee machines to cars, to buses, railway
  stations and airports) are all loosely connected. Trillions of such connected components
  will generate a huge data ocean, and valuable information must be discovered  from
  the data to help improve quality of life and make our world a better place. For
  example, after we get up  every morning, in order to optimize our commute time to
  work and complete the optimization before we arrive at office, the system needs
  to process information from traffic, weather, construction, police activities to
  our calendar schedules,  and perform deep optimization under the tight time constraints.
  In all these applications, we are facing significant  challenges in leveraging the
  vast amount of data, including challenges in (1) system capabilities (2) algorithmic
  design (3) business models.
