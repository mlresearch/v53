title: Scalable SDE Filtering and Inference with Apache Spark
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of Bayesian filtering and inference
  for time series data modeled as noisy, discrete-time observations of a stochastic
  differential equation (SDE) with undetermined parameters. We develop a Metropolis
  algorithm to sample from the high-dimensional joint posterior density of all SDE
  parameters and state time series. Our approach relies on an innovative density tracking
  by quadrature (DTQ) method to compute the likelihood of the SDE, the part of the
  posterior that requires the most computational effort to evaluate. As we show, the
  DTQ method lends itself to a natural implementation using Scala and Apache Spark,
  an open source framework for scalable data mining. We study the performance and
  scalability of our algorithm on filtering and inference problems for both regularly
  and irregularly spaced time series.
