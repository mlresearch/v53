title: Exact and Estimation of Local Edge-centric Graphlet Counts
abstract: Graphlets represent small induced subgraphs and are becoming increasingly
  important for a variety of applications. Despite the importance of the local graphlet
  problem, existing work focuses mainly on counting graphlets globally over the entire
  graph. These global counts have been used for tasks such as graph classification
  as well as for understanding and summarizing the fundamental structural patterns
  in graphs. In contrast, this work proposes a flexible, efficient, and scalable parallel
  framework for the more challenging problem of counting graphlets locally for a given
  edge or set of edges.The local graphlet counts provide a topologically rigorous
  characterization of the local structure surrounding an edge. The aim of this work
  is to obtain the count of every graphlet of size  k âˆˆ{3, 4 }  for each edge. The
  framework gives rise to efficient, parallel, and accurate unbiased estimation methods
  as well as exact graphlet algorithms for counting graphlets locally. Experiments
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exact and estimation methods.
