title: A Sub-linear, Massive-scale Look-alike Audience Extension System A Massive-scale
  Look-alike Audience Extension
abstract: Look-alike audience extension is a practically effective way to customize
  high-performance audience in on-line advertising. With look-alike audience extension
  system, any advertiser can easily generate a set of customized audience by just
  providing a list of existing customers without knowing the detailed targetable attributes
  in a sophisticated advertising system. In this paper, we present our newly developed
  graph-based look-alike system in Yahoo! advertising platform which provides look-alike
  audiences for thousands of campaigns.  Extensive experiments have been conducted
  to compare our look-alike model with three other existing look-alike systems using
  billions of users and millions of user features. The experiment results show that
  our developed graph-based method with nearest-neighbor filtering outperforms other
  methods by more than 50% regarding conversion rate in app-install ad campaigns.
