title: 'FPGASVM: A Framework for Accelerating Kernelized Support Vector Machine'
abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learnings method in
  machine learning. However, their applicability to large problems, where frequent
  retraining of the system is required, has been limited due to the time consuming
  training stage whose  computational cost scales quadratically with the number of
  examples. In this work, a complete FPGA-based system for kernelized SVM training
  using ensemble learning is presented. The proposed framework builds on the FPGA
  architecture and utilises a cascaded  multiprecision training flow, exploits the
  heterogeneity within the training problem by tuning the number representation used,
  and supports ensemble training tuned to each internal memory structure so to address
  very large datasets. Its performance evaluation shows that the proposed system achieves
  more than an order of magnitude better results  compared to state-of-the-art CPU
  and GPU-based implementations, providing a stepping stone for researchers and practitioners
  to tackle large-scale SVM problems that require frequent retraining.
