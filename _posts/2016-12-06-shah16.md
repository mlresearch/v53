title: 'Disease Propagation in Social Networks: A Novel Study of Infection Genesis
  and Spread on Twitter'
abstract: The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) currently diagnoses
  millions of cases of infectious diseases annually, generating population disease
  distributions that, while accurate, are far too delayed for real-time monitoring.
  The ability to instantly compile and monitor such distributions is critical in identifying
  outbreaks and facilitating real-time communication between health authorities and
  health-care providers. This task, however, is made challenging due to the lack of
  instantly available public health information, creating a need for the analysis
  of disease spread on frequently updated social media websites. We introduce a novel
  pipeline based model to generate a real-time, accurate depiction of infectious disease
  propagation using Twitter data. Our approach, an amalgam of natural language processing
  and supervised machine learning, is invariant to mass media hype and significantly
  reduces the noise introduced by the use of tweets. The correlation coefficient between
  the Twitter disease distribution obtained via our approach and CDC data from mid-2013
  to mid-2014 was 0.983, improving upon the best model published for the 2012-13 flu
  season. Our model further correlates well with theoretical models of infection spread
  across airport networks, verifying its robustness and applicability in the public
  sphere.
